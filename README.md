## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: Handles MLB data retrieval and processing
2. **Streamlit UI**: Provides interactive user interface for analysis
3. **Data Maintenance Tools**: Manages the retrieval and storage of MLB statistics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlb-analysis-tracker.git
   cd mlb-analysis-tracker
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Unified Launcher (Recommended)

The `mlb_launcher.py` script provides a unified command-line interface to all system components:

```bash
# Start everything (API server, update data, and launch live tracker)
python mlb_launcher.py --all

# Start API server and main UI
python mlb_launcher.py --api-bg --ui

# Start API server in background and launch live tracker
python mlb_launcher.py --api-bg --live

# Only update data without launching any UI
python mlb_launcher.py --update-all

# Launch live tracker with a specific game ID
python mlb_launcher.py --live --game-id 778549
```

For more options, run:
```bash
python mlb_launcher.py --help
```

### Individual Components

If you prefer to run components separately:

#### Start the API Server
```bash
python run_api.py
```

#### Update Player Data
```bash
python main.py --update-season --update-recent
```

#### Launch the Main UI
```bash
python run_ui.py
```

#### Launch the Live Tracker
```bash
python run_simple.py
```

## Application Views
